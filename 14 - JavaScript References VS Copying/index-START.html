    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const playersCopy1 = players.slice();

    // playersCopy1[3] = 'peterrrrrrr!';
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(playersCopy1);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const playersCopy2 = [].concat(players);
    // playersCopy2[3] = 'peterrrrrrr!!!!';
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(playersCopy2);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const playersCopy3 = [...players];
    playersCopy3[3] = 'peterrrrr!!!!';
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(playersCopy3);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const playersCopy4 = Array.from(players);
    playersCopy4[3] = 'peterrrrrrrrrrrrrr';
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(playersCopy4);



    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const personCopy1 = Object.assign({}, person);
    personCopy1.name = 'peterrrrrrrrr';
    // console.log(person);
    // console.log(personCopy1);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const personCopy2 = {...person};
    personCopy2.name = 'peterrrrrrrrr1';
    // console.log(person);
    // console.log(personCopy2);


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const deepObject = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      subObj: {
        anyThing: '1111'
      }
    };
    const failDeepCopy = Object.assign({}, deepObject);
    failDeepCopy.name = 'peterrrr';
    failDeepCopy.subObj.addThing = 'addedsomething';
    console.log(deepObject);
    console.log(failDeepCopy);

    // oneEasy is to use JSON.stringify() and than JSON.parse(); but if an object has high level deep, it is not good to use this way!!!!
